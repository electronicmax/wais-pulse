This extension is designed for Google Chrome. Tested with 12.0.742.122.
Will probably work with newer ones for a while.

No data is actually captured to disk - captured pages are lost when Chrome 
is terminated. But this should be useful

To install this extension into Chrome, open Chrome.
Go to Extensions. Click "Load unpacked extension". Point it to the parent directory.
